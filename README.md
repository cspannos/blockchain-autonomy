# Social Good Use Cases for Autonomous Decentralized/Distributed Consensus Technologies

This document is a work in progress.

The properties of distributed consensus technologies (in theory) are:

- Decentralization: add description... see https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274

- Distributed: add description... see https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274

- Consensus: add description... (Byzantine Generals problem)

- Disintermediation: add description...

- Trustlessness: add description...

- Immutability: as a distributed ledger technology, blockchain nodes store verifiable records so that if one node is offline the other nodes are able to deliver the required data. Blockchains that have this feature are described as “censorship resistant”.

- Disaggregation:

# Application areas

Application areas of social innovations in which decentralized solutions based on DLTs have shown clear benefits over conventional centralised platform solutions:

a) demonstrating the origin of raw materials or products and supporting fair trade and the fair monetization of labour;

b) allowing for a greater visibility of public spending and a greater transparency of administrative and production processes;

c) participation in democratic decision-making by enabling accountability, rewarding of participation and/or anonymity;

d) enabling the development of decentralized social networks or clouds, or of decentralized platforms for the collaborative economy;

e) managing property, land registry or other public records;

f) contributing to financial inclusion;

g) any other area not listed above.
